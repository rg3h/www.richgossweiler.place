<h1>SideImpact: a contextual, ride-along search engine</h1>
<div class=headerTitle id=sideImpactHeaderTitle>Rich Gossweiler</div>

<br>

<b>familiarity and extensibility:</b> as a pop-up, the surf-along can
appear to be a very light-weight application; an added tool while the user
interacts with their familiar internet browser. In reality, the pop-up is a
full-power application, allowing researchers and developers to escape the
limitations of applet programming. Researchers can couple the power of full
application capabilities with an interface to information streaming from
the user's internet browser.

<br><br>

<b>info-mediary capabilities:</b> Side Impact has the ability to modify
both its interface and the data being presented based on context (e.g. what
the user has been doing) and content (the data streaming in from the
internet). For example, it might pop up a summary window and present a
running summary of a particular page. That summary might be different,
based on what the user has been doing.

<br><br>

<b>privacy, security, reliability, access, installation, customization:</b>
Side Impact is a client-side application. There is no required connection
to a host or risky data storage on a remote server. Development is easier,
since you are writing an application that users download and run
locally. You don't have to deal with server-side reliability, bandwidth or
up-time restrictions.

<br><br>

<b>interaction with server-side applications:</b> of course, there is no
restriction preventing Side Impact from interacting with server-side
applications. Client-server relationships can be very potent (e.g. the
server collecting knowledge about general usage patterns for a site; the
client collecting a specific individual's usage patterns; an integration of
the patterns to help present the right data).

<br><br>

<b>non-web integration:</b> Side Impact has access to other streams of
information such as email, application usage patterns. These are exciting
research opportunities by themselves, and the integration with each other
is a really interesting opportunity for sensemaking and knowledge
management.

<br><br>

<b>collaborative effects:</b> while Side Impact is targeted as a
stand-alone application on a client's local machine, it can create data
(maps) that can be shared, and open "collaborative channels" to allow
direct access to multiple users.
